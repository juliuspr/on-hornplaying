title: Practicing Troubleshooter
---

- Too boring (not enough variation)
- Not motivated
- Don’t believe in succes/Don’t want to succeed

- The practice space is not conductive of good work
- No plan/progression/rhythm
- Too much work/too ambitious/too many other priorities that interfere
- Not suffiecient routine and rhythm
- Lack of collaboration
- Too much collaboration
- Am I on the right track?

Am I aiming too high at once? Have I broken down the challenge sufficiently?

Am I aiming too low? Why am I aiming low?

I am lost!


Ideas what to do differently
For no motivation:

⁃	take an inventory of your dreams, goals. Does the project fit in?
Too much work?:
⁃	make an overview of all ongoing projects, and concerns and things you are responsible for
⁃	Postpone some things
⁃	Let go and cancel some other things that are less important. Saying no is one of the most important skills, and not an easy one to learn.

Am I on the right track?
⁃	your emotions and feelings need to be attuned and aligned with what you do, you will achieve much more.
⁃	Start a folder in your notes and reflect regularly on how you feel about a particular thing you are doing? Is this project something that brings me closer to my goals and aims? Stands in the way?
I am lost!
⁃	take notes, draw a mindmap, get an overview. Think in freeform
