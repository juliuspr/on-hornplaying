No amount of writing would do justice to the art of horn. Horn has to be played and listened to. Go to concerts, listen to recordings.

The following playlist will get you started, however it's by no means exhaustive. Many excellent (especially older) recordings are not available on streaming platforms.

You can also check out services that specialize in classical music, like Idagio.
