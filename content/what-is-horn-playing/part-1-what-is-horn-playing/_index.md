What is this thing called horn playing?

Rather than giving one definite answer I want to focus on the variety of possible ones. Horn playing is a different thing to different people.

The essays in this part summarize some of the ways for looking at horn playing. How can horn playing be understood? Can the different views co-exist? What conflicts arise when we change the perspectives?

For a person new to the field it might be difficult to navigate the different understandings. Especially when those understandings collide. Becoming aware of the tensions will hopefully increase one's confidence in challenging situations.

Most of the perspectives are not exclusive to horn playing. Similar ideas are present in the broader context of music making.

Taking horn playing as a starting point I hope will provoke some questions. Why such a narrow focus? I hope that as we proceed through the chapters the answer will become a bit more clear.

This is an invitation to play with ideas. The content here is not some definite truths, only ways of seeing that should be able to handle critical inspection.
