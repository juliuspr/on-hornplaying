What is air?

Fluid dynamics? Acoustics? Art?


Aim? Coupling between primary and secondary oscillator?
Equalizing pressure between mouth and the horn

As we excite our primary resonator (lips/oral cavity) by letting air pass through the repeatedly closing/opening aperture, we induce the pressure oscillations inside of the secondary resonator (horn/mouthpiece). The amplitude of the induced oscillations in the horn depends on the efficiency of coupling between the primary and secondary resonators, the amplitude of primary oscillations, and losses in the secondary resonator. https://www.trumpetherald.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=80051&sid=f08ed032c2c7f2726988c102e5c5ecdf
