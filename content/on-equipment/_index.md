title: "Things in Horn Playing: or On Equipment"
---

The relationship of a horn player with the equipment is complicated.

On the one hand the equipment is the defining characteristic of horn playing. If there is no horn, there is no horn playing. On the other hand the equipment often goes into the background. It is a tool for the art.

Equipment is also the first concern when starting out. How do you operate the horn? Which instrument and mouthpiece do you choose? Tutors and methods start out addressing these issues. It is also a subject of an infinitely nuanced search for better tools for a professional. Yet stages of extreme focus on equipment are taken over by stages of focus on other matters.
