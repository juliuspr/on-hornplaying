Horn's resistance is an overlooked topic.


## The fear of falling (and trusting the resistance)


Blind blowing


Changing resistance

St√∏tdempere

Leaning

Being glued to resistance
Blowing blindly
Loosing contact with the resistance and the ricochet.

Even air stream??? Air column, air stream

Respecting the tube

## Fear of falling


## Leaning. Trust the horn!

## Literature and other sources

Respecting the tube


Blind Blowing

Leaning

Expanding instrument's walls, blowing to the end of the instrument

The different levels of resistance feel like different "depths of the instrument"
