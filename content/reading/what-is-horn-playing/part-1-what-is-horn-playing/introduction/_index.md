What is this thing called horn playing? There is no one definite answer, but a variety of possible ones. Horn playing is a different thing to different people.

In this part we will learn that: The Point:

- There are several distinct ways of understanding what horn playing is
- These ways are in tension with one another. Can the different views co-exist? What conflicts arise when we change the perspectives?
-
- It's complex.
- It's easy to commit to one view at the expense of others.


The essays in this part survey some ways of looking at horn playing. Becoming aware of the variety and the tensions will help to understanding the field in a more nuanced way.

Most of the perspectives are not exclusive to horn playing. Similar ideas are present in the broader context of music making. I take horn playing as an entry point.

This is an invitation to play with ideas. The content here is not some definite truths, only ways of seeing that should be able to handle critical inspection.

## Why do we have these different ways?

- Music making is a broad phenomenon
- Different cultures and sub-cultures. Values
- In a formalised context (higher education, research) we need to focus. By focusing only on a part of the phenomenon we must divide the phenomenon up - creating different views.
- Like trying to describe the elephant by only describing it's one leg.
