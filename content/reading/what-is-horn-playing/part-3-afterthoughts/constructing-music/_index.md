title: Constructing music

This essay discusses the notion of interpretation in the Western Classical Music. I argue that the notion of interpretation carries with it a number of unfortunate implications from cognitivist learning theories. Conceiving the musician solely as an interpreter stands in the way of a richer discussion of creative acts that any performer is engaged in.

A move towards a constructivist account necessitates reconsideration of several assumptions.

Improvisation is creative - playing with a score is reproductive

The implication of considering artistic activity as skillful acts is that every instance of an act is actively constructed. It doesn't matter whether that construction is based on a score or other source

Artistic is imaginative
Artistic is imaginative and skillful acting

## On Interpretation

No such thing as no interpretation - only unrefined, uninformed, dull. (?)
