Brilliant texts often drown in the literature. This is a collection of book chapters and articles that deserve highlighting.

The problem is two-fold. On the one hand there is an abundance of information. On the other, a lot of sources are out-of-print or otherwise difficult to get hold of.

Some are links, some are full texts.

I thank the authors for their permission to publish their work here.
