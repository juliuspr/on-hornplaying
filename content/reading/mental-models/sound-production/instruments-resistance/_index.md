Horn's resistance is an overlooked topic.

Coming to terms with the resistance

## The fear of falling (and trusting the resistance)


Blind blowing

Topology of the resistance


Changing resistance

Støtdempere

Leaning

Being glued to resistance
Blowing blindly
Loosing contact with the resistance and the ricochet.

Even air stream??? Air column, air stream

Respecting the tube

## Fear of falling


## Leaning. Trust the horn!

## Literature and other sources

Notice how the instrument responds what you are doing - A feedback system

Respecting the tube


Blind Blowing

Leaning

Expanding instrument's walls, blowing to the end of the instrument

The different levels of resistance feel like different "depths of the instrument"

## Resistance and leaning
Elastic resistance
Softening resistance
Getting acquainted with the resistence

## Vertical geografi/topografi/examination of the depths
“dybde” av motstand
Og kjennskap til dybde/topografi


## Senstivity to the instrument’s resistance

Myk kontakt med motstanden. We don’t want to overblow or underblow and it’s important to be playing the instrument that you have and be sensitive to the resistance. Playing your own horn

- Evening out resistance
- “Carrying air”

- Not overblowing: Nudging air intensity
- Overblowing and under-blowing. And their coexistance. Different fingerings, different blowing requirements
