We tend to think that learning to play the horn primarily is about practicing and performing. Setting aside the discussion of what practicing entails, we have to acknowledge other important modes of learning:

- listening
- thinking/imagining/reflecting
- participating

## Examples of participating in music culture

- Going to the concerts
- Talking to musicians and music lovers
- Sharing your thoughts about music
- Taking in other peopleâ€™s thoughts and musics
