An illustration of lung capacity. At any given time there is some air in lungs, say, 30%.

You need some muscle power to push the air out when you get under 30%. When you are above 30% the gravity and the difference in pressure inside lungs and outside takes care of the air getting out.

For optimal perfomance, you should take big breaths so you "operate" in the area between 50% and 90%.

Often people take small breaths up to 50-60%. This causes the need to push the air out making the whole body more tense than it needs to be. The sound quality and endurance suffer.
