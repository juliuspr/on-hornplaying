## What is the relationship of the Metaphors and the thing that they illuminate?

- mixins, rather than inheritance


## Plan

- not hard boundaries, but overlapping layers 

## Dimensions
- ontological: idealist (language, disembodied) / materialist (sports, )
- what value is: intrinsic (hobby, participation, culture) / extrinsic (profession, business)
- phenomenological: locus of consciousness, experience etc
- epistemological: how do we know music?
- view of art: mastery/skill vs coming closer to perfect shapes (formalism)
