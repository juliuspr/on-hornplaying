title: Horn Playing as Identity
---

Becoming a horn player is characterized by extreme path-dependency. Horn player's skills are highly specialized, developed over a long period of time. To perform as a horn player professionally one is dependent on following a relatively fixed path. Changing the profession to horn playing in mid-life is therefore quite unlikely (if not impossible). Preparation for the professional life, some would argue, starts already before entering the formal higher/professional education.

These formative years play an important role in one's self-understanding.


"Out there" the identity of the person who plays the horn is often defined by that activity. An orchestra conductor might talk to a horn player as "Hey, 2nd horn do this and that". The person and the instrument is treated as one.

In many ways horn playing is a very consuming/demanding/immersive activity. Performing at a high level according to cultural standards requires constant practice, physical shape. The combination of high specialization and being consuming shapes the self-understanding.




Horn Playing as Identity thus connects Profession and Hobby metaphors.



Logics:
- you are what you are

The notion of life-long learning and the development of identity might contradict a strong focus on the Identity-analogy. However, fixed mindset is also quite prevalent and arguably is codified into some legal systems.
