title: Horn Playing as Art
---

The Art metaphor is the most difficult. Other metaphors (sports, profession, language) offer relatively stable references. They help illuminate the parts of the phenomenon of horn playing.

The Art metaphor is problematic because it is not a stable concept. The fluid concept to be defined here is horn playing. But we could use horn playing as an example to define what art is. And vice versa. Thus it is easy to get into a circular argumentation.

## Some conceptions of Art

- Work of Art (Werktreue)
- Work of Art (Dewey)

### Horn Playing as Art

- Art is supposed to challenge


### The Art of Horn Playing

- Art is something that requires effort

## Tensions with other metaphors

Since there are many accounts of what art is, it depends on which conception we use to investigate the tensions.

## Art and culture

## Live performance arts: here and now - arts that build up over time and are possible to develop
