title: Horn Playing as Sports
---

Horn Playing is an inescapably a bodily activity. Several accounts [^accounts-sports] describe primarily as an athletic activity, or kind of sports. The characteristics the are emphasised are akin to that of a high-level athlete:

- strength
- agility
- coordination
- speed
- balance
- elasticity
- etc

[^accounts-sports]: Belfrage et al (1982): Practice methods for brass players based on physiological factors (related: Belfrage: "Blechblaser-Sportler" in Brass Bulletin 21, 1978")

The sports analogy implies several logics:

- competition
- achievement, outperforming others
- goal setting, the only thing that matters is aiming to the top
- top shape at all times (best nÃ¥r det gjelder)
- determined, deliberate, tough training
- no pain, no gain
- measurability, objective comparison

On the more positive side it also implies

- play (as in games) and immersion
- mastery and achievement
- clarity of goals

In addition to the measurable, physical aspects, sports psychology has gained increased recognition in music performance in recent years. This embeds horn playing even deeper into the logics of sports. Not only the physical strength and ability, but also the cognitive strategies of sports define this view of horn playing.

## Tensions with other views

Consider the contrast between these two quotes:

> Music is not sports - Henrik Hellstenius

and

> QUOTE from the sports book (Belfrage?)

Viewing horn playing as sports comes into tension with "idealistic" views. By "idealistic" I refer to the views that lean towards idealistic ontology: there is a world of ideas separate from the physical world. It is in this world of ideas that horn playing lives.


## Being a top athlete vs being in shape

## Closed skills vs open-skills
