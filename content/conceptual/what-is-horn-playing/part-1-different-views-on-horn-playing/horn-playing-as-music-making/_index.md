title: Horn Playing as Music Making
---
## Why do we have these different ways?

- Music making is a broad phenomenon
- Different cultures and sub-cultures. Values
- In a formalised context (higher education, research) we need to focus. By focusing only on a part of the phenomenon we must divide the phenomenon up - creating different views.
- Like trying to describe the elephant by only describing it's one leg.
