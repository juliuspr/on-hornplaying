title: Horn Playing as Movement
---

Like other metaphors, the Movement-metaphor is a multifaceted one. It illustrates the activity of horn playing, but also raises some interesting (philosophical) questions.

## Logics




- It is not about sports
- It's about dance
- About gesture(s)
- about "not" moving (Is a horn player moving while playing?)




## Basic Problems

- What is movement?
	- Is movement a sleep-walker-like response to the environmental stimuli?
- Is a horn player moving? Or is it a static activity?
