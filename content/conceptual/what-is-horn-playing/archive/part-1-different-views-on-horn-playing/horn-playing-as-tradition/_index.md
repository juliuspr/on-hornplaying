title: Horn Playing as Tradition
---

Playing the horn takes place "here and now". The closer one is to the "here and now", the less apparent the historical background becomes. Many things in horn playing are done because they were done like that "for generations", yet each new perfomance is a new acts that actuates and continues the historical arc. 

The Tradition-metaphor is closely related to horn playing as culture. In this account I choose to separate them. Tradition emphasizes the historical/temporal dimension, while culture focuses on the social side.
