title: Accuracy
---

For horn players, the idea of accuracy is typically related to the absence of split notes (or kieks). Sometimes it also relates to clean and clear articulation. Older French methods refer to accuracy more generally (De la Justesse - Accuracy). It includes intonating well.


Would it be useful to use the term accuracy to all the aspects that a performance practice considers to be the professional standards?
