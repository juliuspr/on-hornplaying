Auditioning is a strange part of being a horn player.

> Audition is like robbing a bank. Be prepared and consider all the things that might happen. - Musicians’ folklore

Somebody said: “Audition is like robbing a bank. You have to be ready and plan everything well and execute it well”

The  preparation is not what you do in the final stretch before the audition. It is what you are doing every day, it is about what you have been doing so far. It is about building a pyramide.

Audition preparation is a more intense version of the general performance prep.
