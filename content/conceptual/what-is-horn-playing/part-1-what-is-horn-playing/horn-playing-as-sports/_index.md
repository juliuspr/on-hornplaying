title: Horn Playing as Sports
---



Horn Playing is an inescapably a bodily activity. Several accounts describe primarily as an athletic activity, or kind of sports. The characteristics the are emphasised are akin to that of a high level athlete:
- strength
- agility
- coordination
- speed
- balance
- elasticity

Just to name a few.

Logics:
- competition
- achievement
- goal setting, the only thing that matters is aiming to the top
- top shape at all times (best nÃ¥r det gjelder)
- determined, deliberate, tough training

In recent years sports psychology gained increased recognition in music performance education. This embeds horn playing even deeper into the logics of sports. Not only the physical strength and ability, but also the cognitive strategies of sports define this view of horn playing.
