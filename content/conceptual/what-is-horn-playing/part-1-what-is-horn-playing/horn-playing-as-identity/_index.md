title: Horn Playing as Identity
---

Becoming a horn player is characterized by extreme path-dependency. Horn players skills are highly specialized, developed over a long period of time. Changing the profession to horn playing in mid-life is very unlikely (if not impossible). Some would argue that preparation for the professional life already starts before the formal higher education.

Horn Playing as Identity thus connects Profession and Hobby metaphors. At the same time the metaphors of Identity and Profession are in tension. 


These formative years play an important role in one's self-understanding.

Logics:
- you are what you are
-


Identity of the person who plays the horn is often defined by that activity. An orchestra conductor might talk to a horn player as "Hey, 2nd horn do this and that".



The notion of life-long learning and the development of identity might contradict a strong focus on the Identity-analogy. However, fixed mindset is also quite prevalent and arguably is codified into some legal systems.
