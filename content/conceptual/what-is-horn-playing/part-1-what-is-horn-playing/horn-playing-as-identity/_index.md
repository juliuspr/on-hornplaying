title: Horn Playing as Identity
---

Identity of the person who plays the horn is often defined by that activity. An orchestra conductor might talk to a horn player as "Hey, 2nd horn do this and that".

Becoming a horn player is characterized by extreme path-dependency. Horn players skills are highly specialized, developed over a long period of time. Changing the profession in mid-life is unheard of. Some would argue that preparation for the professional life already starts before the formal higher education.

These formative years play an important role in one's self-understanding.

Logics:
- you are what you are
- 


The notion of life-long learning and the development of identity might contradict a strong focus on the Identity-analogy. However, fixed mindset is also quite prevalent and arguably is codified into some legal systems.
