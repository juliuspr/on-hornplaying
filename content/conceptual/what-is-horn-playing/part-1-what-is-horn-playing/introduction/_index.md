What is this thing called horn playing? The answer might seem obvious; accordingly, the question irrelevant. However:

> Too often we take for granted the things that require the most explanation. After all, it's easier to assume we know what something means than it is to explain or define it. [^ragin]

[^ragin]: Constructing Social Research. Charles C. Ragin (1994)

We seem to know what horn playing is either (1) because we are exposed to so much of it or (2) we have preconceptions about it. But horn playing is a different thing to different people.

In this part we will:

- Survey several distinct ways of understanding what horn playing is
- Explore the tensions with between different understandings
- Investigate the reasons why different views exist
- Explore ways of harmonizing and integrating the understandings.
  - Can the different views co-exist?
  - What conflicts arise when we change the perspectives?

Along the way, we'll be cautious about:
- We tend to oversimplify: It's easy to commit to one view at the expense of others.
- Each view has its own logic
- tensions between the different logics present challenges for a constructive discussion

In this part we will describe the different views. These descriptions construct "representations" of the phenomena we are describing. "Representations" are different things the phenomena themselves, from their essence.

Our starting point: horn playing is a phenomenon that has social, cultural, historical and physical dimensions. Engaging with the phenomenon puts us "inside" of it. Being entangled inside a phenomenon (horn playing) is an enacted, embodied, lived act. Said differently: we will distinguish between the 3rd-person and the 1st-person outlook on the world and its phenomena. We will explore what this means in Part 2.

As such it is a human practice that is
- embedded in and gives life to the world of things (physical)
- enacts the conceptual, cognitive and emotional world
- steered by value systems, cultural practices, expectations

Words: Phenomenon, practice, logics, understandings, descriptions, activities of the practice
Analogy, metaphor, comparison

Since we define Horn Playing as a practice, we will investigate how it differ, and how it is similar, to other practices.

The sources for this investigation are:
- literature on horn
- literature on brass/wind
- literature on other instruments
- literature on instrumental practicing


This shows that most of the perspectives are not exclusive to horn playing. Similar ideas are present in the broader context of music making.

This is an invitation to play with ideas. The content here is not some definite truths, only ways of seeing that should be able to handle critical inspection.


Two types of analogies:
- idealist
- materialist

Unnecessary dichotomy?
