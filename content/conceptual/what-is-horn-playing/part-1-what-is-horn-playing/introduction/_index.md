What is this thing called horn playing? The answer might seem obvious; accordingly, the question irrelevant. However, in the words of Charles C. Ragin:

> Too often we take for granted the things that require the most explanation. After all, it's easier to assume we know what something means than it is to explain or define it. [^ragin]

[^ragin]: Constructing Social Research. Charles C. Ragin (1994)

We seem to know what horn playing is because we are exposed to so much of it (paraphrase Ragin). But horn playing is a different thing to different people.

In this part we will:

- Survey several distinct ways of understanding what horn playing is
- Explore the tensions with between different understandings
- Investigate the reasons why different views exist
- Explore ways of harmonizing and integrating the understandings.
  - Can the different views co-exist?
  - What conflicts arise when we change the perspectives?

Along the way, we'll be cautious about:
- We tend to oversimplify: It's easy to commit to one view at the expense of others.
- Certain characteristics of views present challenges for a constructive discussion
- Each view has its own logic, which we will investigate
- be mindful of the fact that descriptions construct "representations" of social phenomena, while being entangled inside the phenomena is an enacted, embodied, lived act. Said differently: we will distinguish between the 3rd-person and the 1st-person outlook on the world and its phenomena.


The starting point for the following discussion is this: Horn Playing is a social, cultural and historical phenomenon. As such it is a human practice that is
- embedded in and gives life to the world of thing (physical)
- enacts the conceptual, cognitive and emotional world
- steered by value systems, cultural practices

All of the above is in constant interaction.

Most of the perspectives are not exclusive to horn playing. Similar ideas are present in the broader context of music making. I take horn playing as an entry point.

This is an invitation to play with ideas. The content here is not some definite truths, only ways of seeing that should be able to handle critical inspection.
