Whereas the Practical dimension is very much a 1st person affair, the Conceptual dimension looks at things from outside (3rd person). The conceptual gaze (way of looking at things) is different from the practical gaze. The conceptual gaze is detached and characterized by a commitment to look from a certain perspective.
