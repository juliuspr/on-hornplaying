## Making mistakes (and punishing yourself for them)

Perfectionism

- Don't hang onto your mistakes. Make sure to do better next time

- Pokerface when do a mistake

- When mistake happens I will deal with it later. Barbara Hannighan
- Hanging on the ceiling with the wrong note (???)
- Focusing on mistake is like looking back. With your attitude you can change the future notes.
