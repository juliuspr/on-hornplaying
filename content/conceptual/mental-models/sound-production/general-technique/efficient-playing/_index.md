## The basic horn technique

A full and relaxed in-breath

A sigh-like out-breath

When blowing, calibrate the speed and the quantity of air to the instrument and the mouthpiece that you are using so that the resistance of the equipment acts a sort of support upon which your air stream can "rest", i.e. basic blowing is like leaning against a wall. Don't push the wall: it will not give in; and don't be distrustful of it: you can let your full weight be supported by the wall.

As you establish this trusting relationship between yourself and your equipment
