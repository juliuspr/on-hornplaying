Goal: efficiently produce as much beautiful tone as possible with as little effort as possible in every dynamic

Sound production is a complex interaction of many things. Breathing, blowing technique, embouchure technique, the way you organise yourself (a nuanced way of saying posture), sound ideal, equipment (instrument and mouthpiece)

Sound the bell. Listen to how the bell is resonating, vibrating
