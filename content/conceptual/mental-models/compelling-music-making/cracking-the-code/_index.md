## Synopsis

This chapter is about two ways to think about learning: linear and non-linear. While it is important to proceed with learning in a systematic fashion, it is also crucial to look for a-ha moments. A teacher can bring you just so far. You have to crack the code

There are several ways to look at learning. One way is to thing that it is a linear process: you gradually gain new knowledge and gradually become better at something. Typically that knowledge would be passed to you by a teacher.

The linear model is not the only one though. An "A-ha" moment is something that most of us have experienced. A moment that suddenly brings you to a higher level, makes your playing better. It is hopefully a common experience. In this view learning is not linear: a relatively flat development is succeeded by a sudden jump. A new insight is gained.
