title: Creating Air Pressure
weight: 5
---

Air escapes the lungs when the pressure inside lungs (your chest) is greater than outside.
There are two ways to create this pressure.

1. When you fill the lungs with air and sigh, the air comes out by itself. The pressure is created by due to gravity (the weight of your body). This is very effortless 
2.

1. Effortless, air comes out without effort, as long as you do not hold it
2. Effort





This is a complicated and contentious topic.
