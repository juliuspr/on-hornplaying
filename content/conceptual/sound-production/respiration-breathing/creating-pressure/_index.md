title: Creating Air Pressure
weight: 5
---

Air flow from the lungs is created when the pressure inside lungs (your chest) is greater than outside.
There are two ways to create this pressure.

1. Fill the lungs with air and sigh: the air will come out by itself. Gravity (the weight of your body) creates pressure inside your chest. Air escapes without effort on your part. See [Yawn and Sigh]({{< relref "yawn-and-sigh">}})
2. If there is any air in your lungs, you can engage the muscles of your upper body to increase the pressure within your chest (thorax). This will also cause the air to escape. Engaging muscles requires some effort.

It is useful to be able to create pressure with both of these methods.





This is a complicated and contentious topic.
