To start blowing there must be some air in our lungs so take a nice relaxed breath (this is not entirely correct as we always have some air in out lungs: just try to push out all the remaining air out of your lungs). Imagine how you feel in the evening after a long day. A bit tired, you want to yawn. Do exactly that, a few times. Just as the mother nature had taught you. Don’t think about playing the horn. Just enjoy the sensation. Warm air filling your chest. The rib cage expanding. The muscles around the lungs being stretched.

And then sigh. As if you want to get the weight of the day off your shoulders. Shoulders so heavy that you cannot hold it anymore and let go. The wave of air escapes your mouth.

That’s it! More or less. There might be a few other things.

## Yawn space vs Apple bite

The idea of biting an apple might be more advantageous than yawning.
