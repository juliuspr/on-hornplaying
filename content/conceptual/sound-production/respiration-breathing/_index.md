- Silent breath

Purpose of [breathing exercises]({{< relref "exercises-and-routines#breathing" >}}):

- Better tone
- Better endurance
- Helps internalize breathing in time
- Helps playing together, when people breath in time

## Air: in and out. Your lungs. Breathing & Blowing - a cycle

An illustration of lung capacity. At any given time there is some air in lungs, say, 30%.

You need some muscle power to push the air out when you get under 30%. When you are above 30% the gravity and the difference in pressure inside lungs and outside takes care of the air getting out.

For optimal performance, you should take big breaths so you "operate" in the area between 50% and 90%.

Often people take small breaths up to 50-60%. This causes the need to push the air out making the whole body more tense than it needs to be. The sound quality and endurance suffer.

- Air leading
- Broad air stream
- Dark air, breathing in
- Full, relaxed breath

- Waste air
- Dark air. DARK AIR
- Using the air up
- Blow the mouthpiece off your face
- Endings as beautiful and pure as the beginnings
- Solidify blow and flow: straight constant big air stream
- Create the need for inhalation. Start by showing what the end result might be to show the need for the breathing and then follow that up with the exercises.

Resting on the resistance. Soft contact with the resistance
Leaning on the resistance/contact
Metningspunkt

Saturation point in air

## Not a good model

- Pushing air out - no no
- Mindless blowing
- Bumpy, inconsistent air stream

## Thoughts

- Broad airstream that is directed, channelised by the round opening, corners and a general funnel direction

Kanalisere luften (embouchyre og fokus into the leadpipe). (funneling the air: from broad to focusd)

## Breathing training

- Breathing ball
- Ping-pong ball
- Yawn and sigh

## Air out: two (correct) modes of blowing/exhaling

- Yawn & Sigh and Leaning onto the resistance/Mindful blowing
- Mindful vs mindless blowing

## Support?

## Practice air flow

- Blow through mouthpiece

- Blow the phrase through the instrument
- Breathing in with the hand
