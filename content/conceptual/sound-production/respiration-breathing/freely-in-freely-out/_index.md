title: Freely in, Freely out
---

Air should enter you lungs freely, without friction. Avoid "sucking" the air in. If your inbreath is noisy, probably the air is not coming in as freely as it could.

On the way out the air should travel freely as well. Avoid "pushing" or "forcing" the air out.


## Ideas for in-breath

- Yawn
- When you are surprised (or someone throws cold water on your face) you take a free, spontaneuos breath.
- Open your throat.
- Breath fully out. Then the body will take a spontaneuos breath
