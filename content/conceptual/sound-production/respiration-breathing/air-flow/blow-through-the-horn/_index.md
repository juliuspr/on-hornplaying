> Most students do not BLOW THRU the horn. They blow INTO the horn. Their sounds are stuffy and nasal.  [^gregwing]

Philip Farkas has a similar sentence:

> ... concentrate on **filling the horn with air**. Imagine how far the horn bell would be away from the mouthpiece if the horn were uncoiled! Try to blow the air which was sent into the horn earlier out of the bell by continually pushing it with more air. In other words, "follow through" with the air. Blow **through** the horn, not **at** it. Develop the tone by getting the feeling that you are **expanding** it. The tone can be stretched and expanded more and more until it is of the utmost intensity and purity. [^farkas]
