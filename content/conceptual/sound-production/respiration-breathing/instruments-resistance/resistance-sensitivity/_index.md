title: Develop Resistance Sensitivity

There are 3 layers of resistance:

- instrument's resistance (the combined mouthpiece and horn)
- embouchure resistance (the point at which lip vibration is greatest)
- mouth cavity and throat

We can find more layers of resistance[^other-layers], but we will keep it simple.






[^other-layers]: Room acoustics could be considered as resistance. Good acoustics have litte resistance, you can play freely and effortlessly. Dry acoustics have great resistance. Some authors have identified also other points of resistance.
