Moving tongue forward is a typical way for starting a note. If you
think that you [hit the notes]({{< relref "hitting-buzzing-catching">}}),
then you might think your tongue is almost like a hammer,
pecking at the lips.

This way of thinking tends to result in unnecessarily large, inefficient tongue movement.

Think that the tongue is moving back with each "attack". It is a short and swift action.

Another way of thinking: drop your tongue as you articulate. The tongue is at the point
where the upper teeth meet the gums at the beginning of an "attack". It then falls down
to where the lower teeth meet the gums.
