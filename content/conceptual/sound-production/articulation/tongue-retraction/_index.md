title: Tongue Retraction
status: in-progress

Tongue moving forward is a typical way for thinking about starting a note. This way
of thinking tends to result in unnecessarily large, inefficient tongue movement.

Think that tongue is moving back. It is a short and swift action.

Another way of thinking: drop your tongue as you articulate. The tongue is at the point
where the upper teeth meet the gums at the beginning of an "attack". It then falls down
to where the lower teeth meet the gums.
