We are covering a lot of different topics in quite some detail in this overview
of efficient playing technique. It is impossible to be aware of all the aspects
at all times.

At any given time you can take 2-3 things to focus on. From time to time go
through the chapters to remind yourself of the details.

Try to distill your own principles, like I have done with
[Efficient Playing - 7 Principles]({{<relref "efficient-playing">}}). Make your
own checklist or [inspiration sheet]({{< relref "inspiration-sheet" >}}) of
things that work for you.
