How we think affects how we act. The idea of "Starting a note" has interesting
expressions in different languages.

- Hitting (German: Sto√üen. French)
- Touching (Spanish: Tocar)

Here are some images used in pedagogy:

- Buzzing a note
- Tasting a note
- Catching a note


The hitting metaphor in particular is somewhat strange. To me, it sounds like taking a
hammer and crushing the tongue into the lips to get a sound out.
What about you catching a note (with your lips) next time?
