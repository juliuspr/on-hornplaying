title: Resting while Playing
status: in-progress
---

Typically we think that playing the instrument means getting tired. Being idle means we rest. While true to a certain extent, we can nuance this understanding.

Wouldn't it be nice if you felt more rested, energized after you have played?

## Notions to address

"Holding a note": do we hold a note, or can we rest on a note?
"Blowing hard": do we exert muscle force, or do we let the air escape by itself, resting on the instruments resistance?




Releasing the sound, not holding the sound

## End Notes

We need to address Being Idle.
