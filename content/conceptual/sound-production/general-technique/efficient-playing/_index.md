In a nutshell, good horn technique is about efficiently producing as much [beautiful tone]({{< relref "beautiful-tone">}}) as possible with as little effort as possible.

## Seven principles of efficient technique [^based-on]

[^based-on]: This list is based on Tom Hooten's list

1. [Air comes freely in]({{< relref "freely-in-freely-out" >}})
2. [Air goes freely out]({{< relref "freely-in-freely-out" >}})
3. [Low mouthpiece pressure on the lips]({{< relref "low-pressure">}})
4. [Healthy Buzz]({{< relref "healthy-buzz" >}})
5. Prepare next note
6. [Activate core]({{< relref "activate-core" >}})
7. Lean on resistance (or Blow *through* the horn)


A full and relaxed in-breath

A sigh-like out-breath

When blowing, calibrate the speed and the quantity of air to the instrument and the mouthpiece that you are using so that the resistance of the equipment acts a sort of support upon which your air stream can "rest", i.e. basic blowing is like leaning against a wall. Don't push the wall: it will not give in; and don't be distrustful of it: you can let your full weight be supported by the wall.

As you establish this trusting relationship between yourself and your equipment
