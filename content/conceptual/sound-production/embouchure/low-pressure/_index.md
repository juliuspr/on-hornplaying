Keep the mouthpiece pressure to the minimum. This will help the lips to vibrate more freely.

## How little pressure is too little?

> Quote Farkas. To produce powerful sound you need a certain pressure


## Some ideas

- imagine a small gap between the lips and the mouthpiece. Like 2 sheets of paper between mouthpiece and the lips.
