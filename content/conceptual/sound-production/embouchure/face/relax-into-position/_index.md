Do not force the muscles into a "correct" position. A correct position is in fact a skill of effortlessly forming the lips in a relaxed, coordinated way. Forcing the embouchure to «look good» will cause unnecessary (and potentially harmful) tension in the jaw.

Activating the correct muscles might get frustrating. Have patience and experiment, also away from the instrument. Use a mirror.

Good position of lips, chin and jaw is relaxed. You can think about "Relaxing into position". Do not wrestle with the embouchure.
