Avoid spreading the upper thin. This reduces endurance, and produces thin, hard sound.

Create a cushion with your lips by focusing the muscles around the mouthpiece. Some images:

- Push the mouthpiece away with the lips (lips centered and forward)
- push the lips away

- Ensure sufficient cushioning of the lip
