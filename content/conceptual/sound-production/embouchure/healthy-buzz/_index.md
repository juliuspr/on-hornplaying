Producing a healthy buzz is the main function of a well-functioning embouchure. Always keep the
quality of the buzz in mind.

You can inspect and improve:
- Buzzing with lips only
- Buzzing on a mouthpiece
- Buzzing with a BERP or similar tool
- "Buzzing" on the horn

When buzzing with lips only and mouthpiece, do so loudly. The buzz should be loud,
generous, full. Be generous with the air.

## Buzzing like a giant swarm of bees

A healthy buzz sounds like buzzing of 10 000 bees; a wild, generous, full buzz.
