Audiation[^gordon] refers to formation of a mental "image" of sound. You can audiate (=form a mental conception of) tone quality, pitch, articulation, phrasing and other aspects.

[^gordon]: The term Audiation was coined by Edwin E. Gordon in his Music Learning Theory

> ... one must have a mental conception of **his** own "ideal" tone. This is acquired by constant listening to others at concerts, on records, or over the air - always with an analytic mind. Decide for yourself if this player's tone isn't too bright, that one's a little too muffled, etc. Gradually you will come to have very definite ideas about which tone is just right. When and if you find a player who has "everything" (according to your taste), don't be afraid to emulate him. You will not be an imitator. The very fact that you admire him shows that you have similar musical tastes, and have a great advantage in having them crystalized for you by an artist.
