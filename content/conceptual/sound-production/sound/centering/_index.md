Centering of sound is about finding where the tone is at its richest. Within each pitch there is a range of different "intonations". You can explore this by bending the notes up and down (See [Bending]({{< relref "bending" >}})). You will notice that it is easiest to produce a rich sound when you aim at around the middle of the pitch.





 Try the [Three Notes]({{< relref "three-notes" >}}) exercise to develop centering.
