This book is about our mental models, when we go about producing sounds on the horn. In this chapter we will:

- Present the idea of a mental model
- Discuss why we need to investigate mental models


TL;DR. We need to investigate our mental models, because they affect how we do things. The better our mental models, the better we practice and performance will be. Becoming aware of our mental models will help to deal with feedback and troubleshoot issues that may arise.

## What is a mental model?

Mental models are the structures of understanding

> We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are. - Author?

-	A lot of information, often conflicting.
-	We create complicated and unwieldy mental models that at some point get in our way.

This is a guide, but also a troubleshooting manual, a structure to help receive feedback

- Sequence. Thought sequence
- How to think is as important as how to do


## Why do we need to investigate them?
- Absence of good ones leads to confusion.
- Good ones add clarity
- They are always already present


Mental models will help with:
- Feedback literacy
- Learning literacy


## What is a good mental model?
- Makes sense
- Easy to grasp
- Structures thinking
- Structures work
- Helps troubleshoot
- Helps with feedback, feedback literacy


## Challenges of learning the horn

Horn playing is simple, until it's not. 


- Troubleshooting
- Receiving feedback and making meaning of it and acting productively on it

## Mental models vs metaphors

## On the use of metaphor

Metaphors are not real things. They help us understand complex ideas by linking other domains that have similar relationships between their entities. Metaphors do not replace things they describe. To give an example of what I mean by this, metaphors regarding breathing are prevalent and some of them are taken to mean the things literally: one such metaphor is breathing to your belly, or your heels. It is a physical impossibility to do so, yet it does sometimes serve as a useful image for a more efficient, larger breath. While the only meaningful thing would be to say breath into your lungs, a more inclusive thought of “using more of your body” extends (correctly) the thought of breathing to encompass the whole of the living body. (Footnote: on philosophy of breathing see the Philosophy part).


## NOTES
How we think affects how we act and approach things.

Mental models are abstractions. Why do we need abstractions?

Confusion

Incidental Mental Models (ones that you are acting upon, but are not aware of)
