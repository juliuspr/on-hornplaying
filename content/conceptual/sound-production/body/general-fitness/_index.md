You need a basic level of fitness as foundation for a good playing technique.
Try to integrate cardio, resistance and mobility training to your daily routine
to stay in shape.

## Adaptations take time

If you don't use it you lose it. Your body adapts to the stimuli you expose it to.
Practicing and exercising give the body the stimulus, but it's during rest that
the body adapts. Work intensely and rest well.
