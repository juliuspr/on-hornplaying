Mental models for thinking about thinking?

We can think about, or reflect upon, our thinking. It is called meta-cognition.

How we think about thinking affects how we think (confused?).


- Being alert
- Characterize the short notes
- Vital
- Awake
(Anthony Marwood)

## Metacognition
- Thinking about your own thinking
- Being aware of your own thinking
- Being aware of whether or not you are audiating
