title: Mind the acoustics
---

Remember to compensate for two acoustic phenomena:

- Shorter notes softer than long notes
- Lower notes softer than higher

Therefore to keep a phrase even, you will need to play shorter notes slightly louder (bring them out). Same for lower notes in phrases which have broader range.
