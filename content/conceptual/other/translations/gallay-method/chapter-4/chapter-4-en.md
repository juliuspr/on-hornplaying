ON THE EQUALITY OF THE SOUNDS AND THEIR ACCURACY.

The horn, in its principle (i.e. played without the aid of the right hand placed in the bell), was an instrument very limited by its nature, considering the small number of notes to which it was restricted. The discovery of stopped tones, with the help of which it was possible to cover the diatonic and chromatic scale, increasing its range, gave it a new appeal and a new versatility; but this improvement made its study more difficult and more complicated.

The notes of the horn were divided into two categories: one comprising the open or natural notes; the other the stopped or artificial notes.

The difference between these two kinds of notes is so noticeable in timbre and volume that the most skilful artist cannot make it disappear entirely: it is therefore this inequality that the student must continually strive to bring the same nuance and equal sonority to all his sounds.

* The principles on this subject taught by M. Domnich are that this inequality of all the notes results from the sole use of the hand placed in the bell, (without the breath contributing anything to it) by opening this hand on the natural notes only as much as their accuracy requires; that is to say, as little as possible, but especially not enough to make these notes bright.

* This principle was also followed by Mr Dauprat in his method.

* Numerous experiments have sufficiently convinced me that a serious disadvantage results from this manner of playing, namely that of sacrificing the most precious quality of the instrument, the beauty of the sounds, to the desire to obtain a single nuance.

* To overcome this problem, it is therefore important to adopt a different method, by which the sound of the artificial notes can be enhanced but without increasing the sound of the open notes; it will suffice to open the right hand as much as possible on the natural notes, and to diminish their brightness, by modifying the breathing; In this way, the natural notes will be enhanced; and in order to preserve the relationship that should exist between them and the artificial notes, the latter should not be subjected to such a great closure, and will consequently be much more sonorous. Nevertheless, this effect is best applied to pieces of music with a slow or moderate movement.

* Finally, in order to obtain the greatest possible equality between these two kinds of sounds, it is necessary to practise alternately on one and the other, striving every day to eliminate the difference that would result from their unceasing comparison.

I would add here that the quality of the instrument used by the performer determines the degree of roundness of his artificial notes, and that, consequently, these notes will have much more volume on a horn that has been played for a long time than on a new one.

I have described the two different methods of attaining relative equality of sound in the French horn; it will now be up to the student, after having tried these two methods, to decide in favour of the one that seems to offer him the best results.
