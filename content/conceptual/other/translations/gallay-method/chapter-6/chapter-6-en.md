VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS TO STUDENTS

The student should only play music that is adequate to his abilities, and therefore should only study the material in the order in which it is presented. Let him realise in advance that premature and ineffective attempts to tackle the difficulties, far from accelerating his progress, may, on the contrary, delay it and sometimes even stop it entirely.

As the nature of the Horn prevents the music from being infinitely diverse and varied, the study of the Piano, Violin or Cello will be more successful in accelerating the development of the musical faculties; the pupil who simultaneously cultivates one of these instruments with the Horn will derive the greatest advantages from it and will add good and useful knowledge to his education.

To become a horn player, one must first of all have a strong vocation; but this is not enough; one must also be physically well built.

The regularity of the teeth on which the mouthpiece rests and the favourable shape of the lips are indispensable and of primary necessity.

The student, especially in the beginning, should keep his practicing short, and by repeating it frequently he will succeed in strengthening his lips, which he would otherwise weaken by forced work.

Since nature has not given all students the same disposition, the areas on which studies should be particularly directed will vary according to individual aptitudes. To those who have a slow and sluggish tongue, I would advise them to practise preferably on lively and light pieces; those, on the other hand, to whom this genre is easy, will do well to vary their studies on pieces of different character and pace.

As soon as the lips get tired and the tone deteriorates, you should stop.

If possible, breathe only on melodic rests, and never wait until the breath is completely exhausted.

Studying too close to the meal and during digestion can be detrimental to good performance and even to health.

Before tuning or beginning a piece with accompaniment, it is necessary to blow into the instrument to raise the pitch, so that it does not suddenly rise after the first few bars. One should also take advantage of the first pauses to adjust the tuning again, by means of the slide, without interrupting the performance.

I cannot recommend too strongly that students refrain from the unfortunate habit of unnecessary preludes; this habit, to which too many instrumentalists are inclined, far from favouring the performance, is on the contrary very harmful to it.

Finally, since I am obliged to point out bad habits, and to speak of the precautions to be taken in order to place oneself, as far as possible, in conditions of success, I will call attention to something to which we do not always attach sufficient importance; that is to the way in which we remove the water from the Horn.

This task can hardly be done properly except during a tutti, or by taking advantage of a few bars of silence. I will mention the method that I have found to be the best.

Before removing the mouthpiece, one must, without producing any sound, give light blows with the tongue to detach the water particles from the walls of the horn, and be careful, as I have seen some people do, not to suck up the water, which would sometimes lead to the swallowing of particles of verdigris. Once the mouthpiece is removed, the horn is taken with the right hand, above the tenon which is fixed on one side to the branch, and on the other to the bell, and it is shaken by giving it a downward movement.

This method works very well with a Cor-solo where all the parts of the instrument are held together. If one wanted to use it with an orchestral horn, one should make sure that before shaking it the crook is perfectly fixed, otherwise one would risk it loosening and bending when it falls. It is safer to use the method I have indicated here:

The instrument is held with the right hand, a little above the place where the crook sits, so that both are perfectly in the hand; then it is turned over, without any jerking or sudden movement, and the water flows out of it by itself.
