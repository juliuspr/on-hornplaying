ON THE PROPORTIONS OF THE MOUTHPIECE

The first thing that a person who intends to study the Horn must do is to choose a mouthpiece that matches the shape and thickness of his lips, both in terms of its diameter and the width of its rim.

As a single model of mouthpiece cannot serve exclusively as a standard, its dimensions varying infinitely, according to the constitution of the individuals, I believe it useful to give two and to add the remarks I have been able to make on this subject; they will serve as a guide to the pupil who will be able to choose between the one or the other, with or without modifications.

I have often found that a small mouthpiece suits thin lips, while thick lips require a larger mouthpiece.

Model No. 1 is therefore intended for the former; as for the latter, they will find in the larger diameter model No. 2 the double advantage of obtaining a better quality of sound and of moving through the entire range of the instrument with greater ease.

As the progress of a pupil can sometimes depend on the mouthpiece he has selected, the choice of mouthpiece is very important, and I think I should call the teacher's most scrupulous attention to this point.

- Dimensions of Both Mouthpieces.
- Outside diameter from edge to edge
- Diameter of the opening
- Width of the rim from inside to outside
- Inner diameter of the tip of the shank.
- Total length of the mouthpiece
