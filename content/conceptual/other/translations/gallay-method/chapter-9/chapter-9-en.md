ON ARTICULATION

To articulate is to express with clarity and precision all the parts that make up a piece; it is even more: it is to know how to give a meaning to the musical phrases, a colour in accordance with their style, and which can vary infinitely while serving as an interpreter for all the feelings.

It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to give any general and absolute rules of articulation, since it is not merely the product of physical strength, of purely mechanical action; it is also the result of intellectual work, of a profound understanding; articulation depends on the character of the melodies and lines, it borrows its charm from the taste and feeling of the performer, it emerges from the qualities of his soul and the beauty of his organisation; and it seems to me that these are things that can be felt and understood, but that one must refrain from attempting to analyse.

I shall therefore confine myself to indicating the manner of rendering the three kinds of articulation in use and to assigning to each of them their proper character.

The SLUR SIGN (cast) placed over several notes indicates that they must be linked together. To express this, it is sufficient to place the first note well and then to produce the following notes with the same impulse, without leaving any interruption between them.

* There is another kind of slur which applies only to ascending notes at one or more degrees of interval and made in a brisk movement: to execute it well, the first slurred note must be thrown over the one that follows and left immediately. This slur greatly facilitates the execution of certain strokes (CODA SIGN) whose design bears some resemblance to those I give below.

(CODA SIGN) This name is given to a sequence of rapid notes performed on the instruments or with the voice.

* The vertical accent placed on the second note of these slurs indicates that this note is to be left suddenly; placed on the other notes indicates the detachment to be discussed.

* The large slur over a number of tied notes means that the separation of these slurs must be almost insensitive.

* The Piqué is marked by a dot placed on the note. To achieve this, the tongue must strike the note without dryness.

The dots, topped by a slur, are usually used in a delicate song, where the notes, though separate, are held together. It is then necessary that the strokes of the tongue be softer and more sustained.

The Detaché, staccato, is marked by a vertical accent, (SIGN OF A WEDGE) the notes over which it is placed must be done with great lightness.

The Piqué sign placed on a half note or whole note reduces its duration by one quarter, and the Détaché sign reduces its duration by half.

Pupils should be very persistent in working on the piqué and the coulé jeté; these two articulations, which are so necessary for the execution of lively pieces, are difficult to acquire on the horn, because of the lightness of the strokes of the tongue they require.
