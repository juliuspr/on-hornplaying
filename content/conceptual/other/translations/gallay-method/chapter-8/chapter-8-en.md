ON TRILL

(1) Here I shall only describe the part of the trill which teaches how to do it. The preparation and the ending of the trill are to be found together with the music, see page 76.

The trill, which many people have called and still call a poor cadence, (2) is one of the most difficult skills to perform with perfection on the horn; it results from the successive and continuous fluttering of two notes with a tone or semitone interval between them. This fluttering must be more or less accelerated, depending on the character of the piece in which it is placed.

(2) The word cadence is used in music to designate the ending of a phrase or momentary rest.

The method of performing the trill taught by the methods that have been published for some years now seems to me to be unsound in that the tongue must remain entirely foreign to its execution, while the lips alone act to pass from the lower note to the higher. Without wishing to deal with this controversial issue in depth and to review all the disadvantages that arise from such a principle, I cannot refrain from offering some of them to my readers for their consideration.

Firstly, the trill made with the lips always has something weak and timid about it, which often contrasts shockingly with the style of the piece in which it is used. Secondly, it is often strained, because in my opinion the lips are incapable of moving with the extreme speed that the trill sometimes requires. Finally, this movement (one might almost say a convulsive one) of the lips, a sort of nervous contraction, makes the face grimace, and the chin feel an unpleasant tremor which can affect the left hand.

On the contrary, it is the tongue, and the tongue alone, that must work to produce the trill; its movements, even the fastest, remain concentrated in the mouth without any external manifestation: the trill, made in this way, has the advantage of being at the same time flowing with greater evenness and fluttering with greater speed, especially in the high notes.

THE WAY TO MAKE THE TRILL.

As the trill cannot be done with the same ease on all the notes of the scale, it will first be necessary to practise on the open tones which are more favourable to this technique than the stopped tones.

The tongue will gently emit the first sound, as in the ordinary stroke; then, to facilitate the alternating passage from the lower to the higher note, it will make light pulses on the inner edge of the lips, sustaining the breath with force; these pulses must be, as it were, undulating, so that the tongue does not strike any blow.

It is easy to get an exact idea of the mechanical play of the tongue in the trill: after having struck the note, it moves forward, and, as I said above, comes to touch the inner edge of the lips, then withdraws on itself by a retroactive movement, and so on until the breath has expired. This continual coming and going (if I may put it this way), binds together the two flowing notes, and produces the trill.

Above all, it is necessary to give the same value to each of the two notes, to flow them equally without rushing them, and to progressively accelerate the beat until one has succeeded in making the trill with a rapid movement. It is only by constant and persistent work that one will succeed in acquiring swiftness and equality in the fluttering of the notes, and consequently in becoming a master of the trill.

* Before beginning the following examples, the student should take in as much air as possible, in order to play them with a single breath; and he should not lose sight of the fact that the slurs should be as close together as possible and that their separation should be barely marked.

EXAMPLES

Start the trill slowly at first and gradually increase the speed.

The tr sign is used to indicate the trill.

Two or three small notes are usually added after the trill to signal its end.

There are several ways of ending the trill; the two I have just given are the most commonly used today; the other endings are modifications employed according to the taste of the performer and the character of the piece he is playing; I mention them in the continuation of the Trill, page 78.
