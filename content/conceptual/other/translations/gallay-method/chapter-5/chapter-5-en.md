ON THE RANGE OF THE FIRST HORN.

The range of the first horn is two octaves, plus a fifth, fourth or third, depending on the crook in which the instrument is played.

In the key of C, for example, the first low note is the C below the lines, and the highest note is the high G, or second G, above the staff.

All the notes of this range can be made in the key of C, although some of them are rather lacking in sonority. (Footnote 1)

(Footnote 1) However, I think it useful to observe that in the high register the sounds are relatively similar in sound, while the low register is more restricted.

The same cannot be said of the range of the second horn, which, having an extra octave, contains gaps and such weak or unreliable low notes that it is impossible to use them to any advantage in any kind of music. However, I must say that, although incomplete in its range, the second horn can be preferred to the first horn in quartets and quintets of wind instruments, because of its low character, which makes it suitable for playing the role of bass.

As for the first horn, its ability to cover the range of high notes, the brilliance of its tone, the purity of its playing, have rightly made it the true interpreter of the song, and, as I have said, almost always make it the preferred instrument of composers when they want to place a solo in their scores.
