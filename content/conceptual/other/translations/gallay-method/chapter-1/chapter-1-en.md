ON THE POSITION OF THE BODY
and the manner of holding the instrument


The Horn can be played sitting or standing, but it is extremely important, whatever position one takes, to stand up straight, without stiffness or affectation, and to pull back the shoulders slightly, giving the chest a little lift, which will expand the lungs and give strength to the breathing organs.

The instrument must be held by the left hand which takes it at the place where the mouth pipe branch moves away from the turns of the tube; the thumb comes to support its left side from the middle joint to the top of the nail parallel to this branch and to fix itself under the stud which holds it, where it leaves a very small space of triangular form. The bell should remain permanently on the top of the right hip.

*Before inserting the right hand into the bell, the four fingers should be brought together, pressing them together with enough force to ensure a perfect fit; the thumb should be joined to the index finger in the same way as the other fingers, so that there is not even the slightest gap. The palm of the hand will be slightly rounded and the top of the fingers should rest on the inner right side of the bell, so that the thumb is approximately under the stud fixed to the tube on one side and to the bell on the other, whose distance it determines. However, care should be taken to leave a space of about four centimetres between the hand and the inner left side.

*The hand, thus placed, must remain in the same place, making no movements other than those necessary to open or close more or less, as far as the accuracy of the notes requires (and according to the proportions indicated under the elementary scales) without the outer tips of the fingers coming away from the bell. (Footnote 1)

*(Footnote 1) Later the pupil can vary this manner and give more freedom to the movements of his right hand.

The elbow, naturally placed at a certain distance from the body, will allow the wrist and forearm full freedom of movement, without losing any of its immobility.

Finally, I cannot recommend too strongly that you avoid any swaying of the body, any movement of the arms, head or shoulders while playing.

If I embark upon too detailed an elaboration, the details will be justified, by recognising how important it is that students become familiar early on with principles which are considered to be sound, and do not acquire any of those habits which have the double disadvantage of looking unpleasant and sometimes impairing the purity of the execution.
