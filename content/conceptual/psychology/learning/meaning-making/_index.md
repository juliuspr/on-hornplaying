title: Meaning Making
---

The thing that I hear from the teacher, or read somewhere: how does that fit into the big picture. Do I need to expand my model, or does it fit somewhere within my current understanding. Is this thing far away from how I understand things so that it doesnâ€™t really make sense?

- identify mental models
- investigate how things relate
- experiment
- talk, reflect, write notes, speculate, research
- curiosity, confusion
