title: Managing Fatigue
---

- Learn to listen to your body
- Think long term: gradually build up your strength
- Practice in different intensity levels
  - Most of your practice should be relatively low intensity. It is important that you don't get tired/fatigued too quickly, because you need put sufficient hours
  - You need some high intensity work, but not that much



## Examples of low intensity work

- soft dynamics
- long breaks in-between repetitions. 1:1 work-rest (or even 1:2 work-rest) balance
- mid- and low range


Clarke advocates playing his exercises primarily softly.
