"On Horn Playing" is a set of resources for anyone interested in making sense of the thing that we call horn playing. The resources are divided into three parts: playing, reading and listening. This division sets the stage for discussing horn playing from various perspectives.

As we will see, horn playing is a complex phenomenon. Most often we are concerned with its practical side: How do I hold the instrument? How do I play the high notes? How (much) do I practice? What's the best routine? These are non-trivial questions. To answer them in a nuanced way we actually engage in quite a lot of theorizing.

But the practical dimension is only a part of the story. We can also discuss horn playing from a conceptual/philosophic perspective: What kind of thing is horn playing? This is an ontological question. It aims at the nature of horn playing. What kind of thing is it? What distinguishes it from other things? When we apply knowledge from, say, sports does horn playing become a sport?

Another group of philosophic questions is epistemological questions. How do we know horn playing? What kind of knowledge is involved in playing? How do we exercise that knowledge? How do we learn to play? Is playing the horn a purely motoric activity void of any cognition? Is knowledge of playing verbal/discursive or of some different type, i.e. if I can talk about how to play the horn playing, does it entail that I can play the horn?

The goal of these resources is to draw out the connections between the practical and the conceptual sides of horn playing. How we think affects how we act, and vice versa.

## Overview. How to use the resources?

The Playing part is the most practical: the resources are meant for practical engagement.

The Reading part connects the practical and the conceptual. On the one side we have
- the description of skills that define a horn player
- a repository of practice strategies

On the other, we discuss the ontology and epistemology of those skills and strategies.

The Listening/Participating part is about being in the culture.

## False dichotomy between practical and conceptual

I make the distinction between the practical and conceptual and say that the reading part is less practical.

In fact, all three parts are both conceptual and practical. By playing we engage in implicit theorizing and lived philosophy. By listening and participating we acquire knowledge about the music that we are listening to and the contexts in which we participate in.

The Reading part is also a very practical endeavour. Reading itself is not some sort of metaphysical activity: its very practical. Making sense of the content is also practical, and requires reflection, discussion, trying out.
