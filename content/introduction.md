"On Horn Playing" is a set of resources that presents horn playing from three perspectives:

- Practical
- Conceptual
- Cultural

"Traditional" literature on horn is primarily concerned with its practical side [^overview-horn-literature]. How do I hold the instrument? How do I play the high notes? How (much) do I practice?

[^overview-horn-literature]: Horn literature survey. Types of literature: tutorials, guidebooks, basics.

But by discussing the practical topics we theorize. We develop a conceptual understanding. The practical and conceptual are thus intertwined.

The practical and the conceptual are furthermore embedded in cultures. What we do and how we understand depends on where and when we live. Our culture thus shapes our practices. But practices also shape cultures in return [^rephrase].

[^rephrase]: How we think affects how we act. And vice versa. How we think and act is shaped by our culture(s). And the culture(s) are shaped by how we think and act.

The interaction between the practical, the conceptual and the cultural is at the core of these resources. Whenever you look at one part, remember the others. Which brings us to the second core idea behind these resources: 1st person perspective.

## Overview of the resources

The Practical part mostly consists of sheet music. You can play the exercises, etudes etc.

The Conceptual part provides context to the Practical. This part spans from the nitty-gritty details (like strategies for practicing and the mental models) to asking "What is Horn Playing?". Asking such a basic questions will take us through a fascinating world of ideas surrounding horn playing.

The Cultural part has two dimensions. On the one hand, we zoom out and look at ourselves "from the outside". On the other hand, it is what gives horn playing its meaning. It is something that is "close to the bone"
