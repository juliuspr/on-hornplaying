"On Horn Playing" addresses the question: what is this thing called horn playing?

To do so, we look at horn playing from three perspectives:

- Practical
- Conceptual
- Cultural

"Traditional" literature on horn is primarily concerned with its practical side [^overview-horn-literature]. How do I hold the instrument? How do I play the high notes? How (much) do I practice?

[^overview-horn-literature]: Horn literature survey. Types of literature: tutorials, guidebooks, basics.

But by discussing these topics we theorize. We develop a conceptual understanding. The practical and conceptual are thus intertwined.

The practical and the conceptual are furthermore embedded in cultures. Participating in a culture shapes how we do things and what assumptions underlie what we do. Culture thus shapes its practices. But practices also shape cultures in return.


How we think affects how we act. And vice versa. But we do not act and think in a vacuum. Thus how we act and think is cultural.

A central assumption of this text is that, while we can bracket out some perspectives, horn playing is always an interplay of all three. This complexity makes horn playing a fascinating subject to study.


We will thus look at the three sides both in isolation and how they interact with one another.


For example, the language we speak influences how we think about a particular topic. How we think affects how we act, and vice versa, which then becomes culture.




- Horn playing is a complex phenomenon.
- Its practical, conceptual and cultural sides are deeply intertwined



So the seemingly simple "practical" questions may not be as trivial as they might seem. This is the main goals of this website:

- acknowledge the three parts
- investigate them in depth

- Practical: playing/creating/imagining,
- Conceptual: reading/theorizing/understanding/conceptual/language/philosophy
- Cultural: listening/participating/



## What kind of investigation is this?



A more traditional scientific inquiry attempts to focus on a smaller sub-part of the phenomenon. This requires taking for granted


While a pan-vision (seeing everything at once) is impossible, I hope we can let our focus wander freely, while still in a structured manner.













But the practical dimension is only a part of the story. We can also discuss horn playing from a conceptual/philosophic perspective: What kind of thing is horn playing? This is an ontological question. It aims at the nature of horn playing. What kind of thing is it? What distinguishes it from other things? When we apply knowledge from, say, sports does horn playing become a sport?

Another group of philosophic questions is epistemological questions. How do we know horn playing? What kind of knowledge is involved in playing? How do we exercise that knowledge? How do we learn to play? Is playing the horn a purely motoric activity void of any cognition? Is knowledge of playing verbal/discursive or of some different type, i.e. if I can talk about how to play the horn playing, does it entail that I can play the horn?


## Overview. How is it structured? How to use the resources?



The Playing part is the most practical: the resources are meant for practical engagement.

The Reading part connects the practical and the conceptual. On the one side we have
- the description of skills that define a horn player
- a repository of practice strategies

On the other, we discuss the ontology and epistemology of those skills and strategies.

The Listening/Participating part is about being in the culture.

## False dichotomy between practical and conceptual

I make the distinction between the practical and conceptual and say that the reading part is less practical.

In fact, all three parts are both conceptual and practical. By playing we engage in implicit theorizing and lived philosophy. By listening and participating we acquire knowledge about the music that we are listening to and the contexts in which we participate in.

The Reading part is also a very practical endeavour. Reading itself is not some sort of metaphysical activity: its very practical. Making sense of the content is also practical, and requires reflection, discussion, trying out.




## Goal

An account that is
- Vygotsky/Engestr√∂m - Activity theory
- Husserl/Heidegger/Morleau-Ponty/Dreyfus - Being-in-the-world, tool analysis
- Latour - sociomaterial
