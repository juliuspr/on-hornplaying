"On Horn Playing" presents horn playing from three perspectives: practical, conceptual, cultural.

The [Practical](../practical) perspective is about doing. Here you will find things you can practice and perform, like exercises, practice tips, etudes and repertoire. It often goes into nitty-gritty details.

The [Conceptual](../conceptual) perspective is about thinking. While horn playing is simple in some regards, it is immensely complex in others. We will ponder upon the question "What is Horn Playing?" and explore the world of ideas that surround horn playing. This provides the context to the practical perspective.

The [Cultural](../cultural) perspective is about being. As horn players we are a part of a culture. Culture is where and when we live, the things and the ideas that surround us.

In short: to understand Horn Playing we need to see the interplay of these three perspectives. Our cultures shape how we think. Our thinking affects how we act. And how we think and act shape cultures in return. It's a perpetual circle.
