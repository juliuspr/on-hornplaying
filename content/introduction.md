"On Horn Playing" illuminates the question: what is horn playing? To do so, we look at horn playing from three perspectives:

- Practical
- Conceptual
- Cultural

"Traditional" literature on horn is primarily concerned with its practical side [^overview-horn-literature]. How do I hold the instrument? How do I play the high notes? How (much) do I practice?

[^overview-horn-literature]: Horn literature survey. Types of literature: tutorials, guidebooks, basics.

But by discussing the practical topics we theorize. We develop a conceptual understanding. The practical and conceptual are thus intertwined.

The practical and the conceptual are furthermore embedded in cultures. Participating in a culture shapes how we do things and what assumptions underlie what we do. Culture thus shapes its practices. But practices also shape cultures in return.


How we think affects how we act. And vice versa. But we do not act and think in a vacuum. Thus how we act and think is cultural.


## Overview. How is it structured? How to use the resources?

The Playing part is the most practical: the resources are meant for practical engagement.

The Reading part connects the practical and the conceptual. On the one side we have
- the description of skills that define a horn player
- a repository of practice strategies

On the other, we discuss the ontology and epistemology of those skills and strategies.

The Listening/Participating part is about being in the culture.
