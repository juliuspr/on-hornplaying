## How to?

With your palm flat:

- bring the index finger to your nose
- the soft part to your lips
- tuck the thumb into your palm
- open your mouth as if to yawn (or bite an apple)
- fill your lungs with air

Notice the deep sound of that inhale. Bright sound indicates restricted airflow.

Exhale holding your extended hand in front of you. Demo https://youtu.be/ty5fbD0bvtQ?list=PLh-0RvWP6a2JsWqgo8GQitTQqBvblDfLP&t=163

We want the inhale-exhale cycle to be seamless, like a pendulum.
