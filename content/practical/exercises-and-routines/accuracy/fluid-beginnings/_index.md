title: Fluid beginnings (no hesitation)
---

Some players develop a hesitation before starting a note. This hesitation often manifests itself in a particular context: in particular high or low range, or slow tempi.

[Here is an exercise that will help to reduce the hesitation, develop a fluid breathing cycle, and uninhibited note beginnings.](./fluid-beginnings.pdf)



## Get rid of the fear of high (low) notes

Learning Activity: Similar to the above exercise. On one of the repetitions surprise yourself with the same note an octave higher or lower. Make a decision to change the octave as late as possible.
