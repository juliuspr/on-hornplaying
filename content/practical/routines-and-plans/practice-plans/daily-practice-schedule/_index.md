A serious student should practice three to four hours a day[^practice-quantity].
Here is one way to help you jugle the different areas of work.

[^practice-quantity]: See an article about practice quantity.

| A two-session day  |  A three-session day |
|---|---|
| 08:00-09:30 Session #1 (Playing duration: 60-90 mins) |  08:00-09:30 Session #1 (Playing duration: 60-90 mins)
11:00-19:00 Lunch, Rest, Dinner, Other commitments | 09:30-10:00 Rest
19:00-21:00 Session #2 (Playing duration: 60-90 mins) | 10:00-11:15 Session #2 (Playing duration: 30-60 mins)
I do not recommend squeezing 4 hours of practicing into two sessions.  | 11:00-19:00 Lunch, Rest, Dinner, Other commitments
  _  | 19:00-21:00 Session #3 (Playing duration: 60-90 mins) |


## Session #1

1. Warm up (2-5 min) - Low intensity
2. Flexibility (~10 min) - Low-to-medium intensity. [Open harmonics]({{< relref "open-harmonics-two-octaves">}})
3. Stability (~10 min) - Low-to-medium intensity. [Long tones]({{< relref "long-tones" >}}),
4. Mobility (~10 min). [Scales]({{< relref "exercises-and-routines#scales" >}}), Clarke
5. Rest (2-5 min)



## Important considerations

- Spread the sessions throughout the day.
- Plan sufficient rest and try to be well rested for each session.
- Balance high and low intensity work

There are many ways of structuring schedule.
