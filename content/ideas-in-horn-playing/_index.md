A collection of essays that illuminate the central ideas in playing the horn. The ideas might seem unusual. However, I consider them to be [Threshold Concepts]({{< ref "threshold-concepts.md" >}}). Such ideas, once internalised change the way you see the world. You approach playing differently when you see things differently.
