This anecdote illustrates an idea that doesn't have a proper name. It is described in the literature as rather important, yet it is not often clear what is meant by it, and what role it has.

Audiation roughly refers to the idea of imagining sound prior to producing it.

Although the term might be unfamiliar, the idea itself is old. Because different authors and pedagogues have used different names and descriptions, the idea has sometimes become lost.

## Fill your head with sound (and the content of the consciousness)



"Anticipation - which is extremely important - so that's not to be taken by surprise" Menuhin Lesson 1

## Issues with Audiation

### Is it always creative? Productive? Or is there such a thing as reproductive hearing/audiation?


### Inner ear, inner hearing, audiation?

Is audiation hearing? Types of perception. The content of consciousness.
