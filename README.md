## Acknowledgments

This book is above all a synthesis of ideas that I have learned from my teachers, peers, students, from my reading of literature from a range of authors, as well as my own journey as a performer and teacher. I am indebted to a great many people who have informed, inspired, supported, guided me.

Most of the ideas are not new are the result work of many people. I am deeply grateful for having the privilege to build on those ideas. I hope that I managed to synthese and present them in a meaningful way. Any misrepresentation of the ideas or errors are mine alone and their original authors.
